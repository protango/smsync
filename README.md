Smsync is a powershell utility designed to help manage git repositories with submodules.
It is a fully interactive command line program which supports any submodule configuration, including complex nested structures and siblings.

Primarily, it is designed to make pushing and pulling submodule updates a quick and simple process.
Simply running "smsync" at **any** location within the repository will update all modules to the latest commit, and will also optionally commit any changes made too.
